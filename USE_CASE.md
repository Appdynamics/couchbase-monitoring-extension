# AppDynamics Extension for CouchBase Monitoring
 
Couchbase Server is an open source, distributed (shared-nothing architecture) NoSQL document-oriented database that is optimized for interactive applications. This extension allows the user to connect to a specific cluster host and retrieve metrics about the cluster, all the nodes within the cluster and any buckets associated with the nodes.
